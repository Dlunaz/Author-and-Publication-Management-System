📚 Publication & Authors Management System

This project implements a Publication, Authors and Citation Management System designed to efficiently store, organize, and analyze academic publications and their relationships between authors.

The system models citation networks and author–publication relationships using optimized data structures to ensure scalability and performance.

----- Features -----

** Management of publications and authors

** Representation of citation relationships between publications

** Tracking of author contributions

** Efficient data retrieval and relationship queries

** Technical Implementation

The system leverages fundamental data structures for performance and clarity:

** HashMaps – for fast lookup of authors and publications by unique identifiers

** Adjacency Lists – to represent citation graphs between publications

** Arrays – for structured storage and indexed access to collections

----- Academic Project -----

Developed in 2025 for the Data Structures and Algorithms course of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering for Management and Information Systems at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), School of Engineering, Bilbao.
